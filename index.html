                    <b>Not to mention, Neptune</b> <br> 
                    It is a strange frigid, and black planet. 
                    Neptune may be far, <span class="blue">cold</span>, and mysterious, 
                    but it‚Äôs one of the most intriguing planets in our Solar System.
                    Because of the methane in its atmosphere, it is renowned for having a <span class="blue">deep blue color</span>.
                    With gusts of up to 2,100 km/h, Neptune has the fastest winds in 
                    the entire Solar System! Additionally, it has the most active climate, with 
                    <span class="violent">violent storms</span> that appear out of nowhere.

                Despite its distance from the Sun, Neptune's axis 
                spins quite quickly. The days of Neptune are significantly 
                shorter than those of Earth since a whole revolution (a "day")
                 only takes roughly 16 hours. It takes an incredible 
                165 Earth years to complete a single orbit of the Sun, 
                but its year is a another matter! 
                Thus, Neptune's year is incredibly lengthy, 
                even though its days are brief!

                    <b>Pluto</b>,<br> 
                    formerly regarded as the ninth planet in our cosmic family, 
                    has a unique history as distinct as its far-off orbit. 
                    Don't be fooled by its small size, coldness, and mystery; 
                    Pluto has several intriguing characteristics that put it at the 
                    forefront of space exploration.
                    
                    In other words, Pluto occasionally passes within Neptune's orbit,
                     yet they are protected from collision by a unique gravitational dance. 
                     Pluto is circling the Sun in a picturesque manner!
